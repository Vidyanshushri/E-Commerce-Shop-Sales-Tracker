# E-Commerce-Shop-Sales-Tracker

I recently worked on an in-depth sales tracking analysis for an e-commerce business, covering quarterly, monthly, and yearly performance trends. Using Power BI, Excel. I created interactive dashboards that provide clear insights into revenue, order status, and overall business growth.

Key insights from the analysis: ✅ Sales trends over different time periods ✅ Performance comparison across quarters ✅ Revenue patterns and growth insights ✅ Order status tracking for better decision-making

This project helped me deepen my understanding of data visualization and business intelligence while improving my analytical skills.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Also open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts.
